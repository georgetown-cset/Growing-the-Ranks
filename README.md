# Growing-the-Ranks
Annex for "Growing the Ranks of Top Research Institutions from Untapped Sources" published in *The HBCU Digest*.


Still To Do...

Table 1 below presents 2023 totals for research PhD conferrals (source: IPEDS, see Note below) and R&D expenditure (source: HERD, see Note below) for the 29 research doctorate-granting HBCU institutions. The numbers in the parentheses represent the average for the past three years, 2023 - 2021. Note that starting in 2025 Carnegie will use the highest of these two numbers to determine research classification status. The Carnegie classifications are determined using data from the National Science Foundation (NSF) National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) Higher Education Research and Development (HERD) survey and the U.S. Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences National Center of Education Statistics Integrated Postsecondary Education System (IPEDS).
