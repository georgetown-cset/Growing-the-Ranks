# Annex for *Howard's R1 achievement is great. HBCU R2s may be an even greater story* 

This Annex provides the supporting data for the article [*Howard's R1 achievement is great. HBCU R2s may be an even greater story*](https://educationnewsflash.substack.com/p/howards-r1-achievement-is-great-hbcu) published in [*The HBCU Digest*](https://educationnewsflash.substack.com/ "HBCU Digest").


Table 1 below presents 2023 totals for research Ph.D. conferrals and R&D expenditure for the 29 research doctorate-granting HBCU institutions that are classified as R2 or potentially aspire to R2 classification under the Carnegie research classification system, as well as the average of these values over the past three years (2021 - 2023). Starting in 2025 Carnegie will use the highest of these two numbers (current total and 3-year average) when determining research classification status. 

The Carnegie classifications are determined using data from the National Science Foundation (NSF) National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) Higher Education Research and Development (HERD) survey and the U.S. Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences National Center of Education Statistics Integrated Postsecondary Education System (IPEDS). 

The specific sources of data in Table 1 are as follows:
* Research Ph.D. conferrals are sourced from the National Center for Education Statistics, *Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System,* [IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/InstitutionByName.aspx?sid=e63aa0ec-8ce9-4250-8103-6f4085d39e6a&rtid=1 "IPEDS Lookup")
* R&D expenditure data are sourced from the National Center for Science and Engineer Statistics' *Higher Education Research and Development (HERD) Survey,* [HERD](https://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/higher-education-research-development/2023 "HERD")
* The definition of STEM fields is sourced from the Department of Homeland Security's [*Study in the States*](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/stem-opt-hub/additional-resources/stem-opt-extension-overview) which defines the list of degree programs that comprise STEM.
